# Notelet - the nonlinear-notetaking app

Notelet is a notetaking app built upon stickynotes. it is my first experience in windows app development using wxWidgets.

The app currently offers only stickynotes with all of their functionalities but I aim to add other features like to-do lists and images 

## Basic controls
- On the left panel, you have the color pane on the top. You can choose what color to change: foreground or background, and then choose the color for that choice. The color chosen will appear beside its corresponding radiobox.
- On the left panel, you have the add note options on the bottom. First enter your note text in the text box, choose your formatting: **bold**, * **italic** *, or **Underlined**, then click **add** or **Ctrl + N** to create new.
- If you want to modify the note, click on the desired note, select your modificaitons, enter the new text, and then click *update*.
- You can drag any note on the work area
- To put a note on the top, first select the note and then click *Home* key on the keyboard
- To put a note on the bottom, first select the note and then click *End* key on the keyboard
